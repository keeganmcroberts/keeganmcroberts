## :earth_americas:Hey! Im Keegan!

Recently graduated full-stack Software Enginner who loves to learn and looks forward to mastering my abilities in this industry. 

I love collaborating on projects and working in teams in order to accomplish the goal at hand. I believe learning is a cooperative process and love to learn something new about coding every time I work with my peers. 

I approach coding with the same approach that I take with many of my other life's passions - whether it be playing a new sport, learning a new song on a guitar, or beating a hard video game - I embrace the challenge and love to push myself.
