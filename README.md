## :earth_americas:Hey, Im Keegan!

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with extensive training in Javascript, ReactJS, and Ruby on Rails. After having completed my undergraduate studies at Colorado State University with a BS in Public Health and Exercise science, I worked shortly in the healthcare field as a Registered Behavior Technician. With a recent career transition, I decided to take my creative outlook, collaboration skills, and adaptable mindset into the tech field.
