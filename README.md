Hey! Im Keegan!

Recently graduated full-stack Software Enginner who loves to learn and looks forward to mastering my abilities in this industry. 

I love collaborating on projects and working in teams in order to accomplish the goal at hand. I believe learning is a cooperative process and love to learn something new about coding every time I work with my peers. 

I approach coding with the same approach that I take with many of my other life's passions - whether it be playing a new sport, learning a new song on a guitar, or beating a hard video game - I embrace the challenge and love to push myself. 


Projects:

Concert Tracker - Github | Demo
A concert tracking website which allows a user to sign in, search for concerts based on a city, artist, or venue, and track each band/ venue by adding them to their personal profile.
Ensured user authentication and authorization of user by use of the params hash, sessions hash, and .authenticate on the backend to maintain a safe and secure log-in for a user. 
Built with React JS front-end, custom database schema built with the MVC pattern in Ruby on Rails, and fully unique CSS in order to simulate the experience of tracking real-life upcoming concerts. 

An Immersive Game Review - Github | Demo
An immersive game review app to help users view/rate games, game reviews, game trailers, and listen to game soundtracks. 
Created fully with ReactJS on the back end and a local db.json server used to simulate the backend. 
Implemented unique functionality such as embedded video/audio players using third party React components and pre-built javascript classes such as Audio.
